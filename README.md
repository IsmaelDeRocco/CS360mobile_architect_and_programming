Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
-The main goal for this application was to take inventory of multiple products and how much of each item is available. 
The user needs to be able to login into a secure application, then edit a database that contains all the products available. 


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? 
How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
-The application has multiple screens, the first being the login screen. No one can see anything in the 
inventory database unless they have a authorized login information. After that, they can see the currently database that’s saved.
The next window is where new items can be added into the inventory. After that there is a button that will take the user to a List of all the items.
I kept the design simple yet effective. I didn’t want there to be to much going on, the purpose of the application is to take inventory nothing else just yet. 


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
-The approach I did for this project was to first mockup a design on paper, then I drew one digitally on my
computer. Before starting the whole coding process, I just laid out all the buttons and windows so they would be 
ready for when I start the coding process. This helped me see the program before I started giving each key functionality. 


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
-When testing the code, I would constantly recompile the code every couple of lines of code. This ensured that
the currently code wasn’t the problem with my program. Id rather fix a bug as im going then being stuck with numerous 
bugs all at the end that might not even be able to be fixed without a lot of work being done to the entire program. 


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
-Where I had to innovate to complete a challenge would probably be when I started the coding process. We were given the textbook,
but some of the things I needed to learn on my own to help create this application. I had a good time researching different ways on 
helping to complete this application.


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
-The specific component I’m proud of is going to have to be my database manager. I learned a lot through the teacher, the textbook, 
and videos on how making this type of database manager can be using in many different applications and hope to also bring it into other projects as well.
